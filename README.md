# Assignment-5-Kaggle.com-Classifier-Competition
For this assignment we had to use 3 rounds of submissions to a kaggle.com competition. For each round we had to use a different type of classifier which we had learned about during the course of the semester. We were allowed to use pre-existing library implementations of these classifiers.
For the classifiers I used sklearn's MLPClassifier, sklearn's RandomForestClassifier and sklearn's KNeighborsClassifier for rounds 1, 2 and 3 respectively. My best performing classifier was the MLPClassifier after I performed many test runs and tuned the different parameters.
Included in this project is a report detailing the steps I used while implementing each classifier along with my results and what I learned from this assignment. Also included in this project is the 3 python files containing each classifier I used, the test and training data files used to train and test each classifier, and the final estimated classifications for each classifier on the test data. These final estimated classifications is what was submitted to kaggle.com to recieve a score for the classifiers (the lower the score the better for submissions with 0 representing a 100% correct classifier).

My best ranking classifier was ranked #888 on the leaderboards at the time of this submission.
